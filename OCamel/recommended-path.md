# Recommended Path For Me:

* Start with “Real World OCaml” → to quickly get into modern OCaml + ecosystem.

* Dip into the CS3110 text (OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful) → for sharp insights on modules, functors, and idioms.

* If you enjoy exercises and side explorations → pick up More OCaml.
